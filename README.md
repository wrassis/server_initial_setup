Hello, everyone! 0/

This playbook makes the initial server config for `ubuntu` servers:
1. Install `aptitude`;
1. Setup passwordless `sudo`;
1. Create a new regular user with `sudo` priviledges;
1. Update system and install some packages;
1. Install and setup `UFW` firewall for `SSH` connections.

Enjoy it! ;)
